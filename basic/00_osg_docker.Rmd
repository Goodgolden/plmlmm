## My docker 

```
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/goodgolden5/randy
```

everytime I push the osg will take a hour to update


## to set the Image to work

```
+SingularityImage = "/cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/goodgolden5/randy:tag01"
```

no transfer_in/out files anymore

## requirement 

add rjags and the jags cannot be used if it is not in the container.

## if the image is ready then submit the job.

```
ls /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/goodgolden5/randy:tag01
```


## remember to add the $Cluster $Process
otherwise it will overwrite the same file again and again.

It will work like a shell

```
docker run -it --rm goodgolden5/randy:tag01 bash
```

## this is for my own working shell

```
singularity shell /cvmfs/singularity.opensciencegrid.org/goodgolden5/randy:tag01
```
