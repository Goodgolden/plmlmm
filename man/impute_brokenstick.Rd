}
\arguments{
\item{outcome_var}{The outcome_var variable name must include in the dataset}

\item{time_var}{The time variable name must be included in the dataset}

\item{id_var}{The id variable name must be included in the dataset}

\item{bs_knots}{The internal knots for brokenstick model}

\item{anchor_time}{The anchor time set for imputation,}

\item{data}{A data frame in which to look for variables with which to fit the brokenstick model and predict. Ideally, this is a longitudinal data.frame object in long-format.}

\item{...}{Not used, but required for future extension}

\description{
The predictions from a broken stick model coincide with
the group-conditional means of the random effects.
This function takes the \code{data} with selected \code{outcome_var}, \code{time_var}, and \code{id_var}.
The user can calculate prediction (imputation) at given anchor \code{time} set.
